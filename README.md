# Spacemacs-inspired bindings for NvChad

My personal NvChad configuration aims to provide a Spacemacs-like experience
inside NvChad. This is mostly due to years of deeply ingrained muscle memory. I
will switch over to NvChad conventions over time, though.

This repo started as a clean copy of
NvChad/starter@e3572e1f5e1c297212c3deeb17b7863139ce663e. On top of that I shall
add my own configuration.
